Warhammer Fantasy RolePlay 2 edition has a lot of data to follow for game masters, especially during combat.
That's why I'm making a code that keeps track of all things for the game master.

I'm using Object Oriented Programming paradigm, so that different classes could inherit methods from their parents.
Ex. Parent Class Character and it's children - PlayerCharacter and EnemyCharacter.
